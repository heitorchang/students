began project as keyenglish on 4.oct.19 

Backend
[  ] do not pass teacher id from client, but use it from request user in django
[  ] handle AJAX error codes (400 bad request when making new student), error notifications after AJAX calls (grep -Iir 'then' * in ui/templates dir)
[  ] check for time conflict when adding a class
[  ] monthly report of classes
[  ] view to download only a month of lessons
[  ] idea: to keep track of what dates were downloaded, keep track of dl_begin and dl_end (year/month), and extend these after downloading
[  ] figure out why Error: network error appears on adding student

[OK] update notification's new status when dismissing it


UI
[  ] test add/edit interaction
[  ] close modal in finally block?
[  ] allow submitting blanks, remove "0", "anonymous" nonsense
[  ] toast after successful add/edit
[  ] disable submit button on modals while network processes it
[  ] student list shows next class as computed property
[  ] prev/next link in monthly component, should download new data
[  ] Select dropdown for students
[  ] get mm for monthly from $parent, not prop
[  ] replace vue js with min version
[  ] block screen while saving JSON
[  ] Use vue min in bundle
[  ] remove JS alerts
